Random Collection of Audio Tools in Python

The tools are loosely based on the timbretoolbox as found

Matlab Toolbox accompanying the paper "The Timbre Toolbox: Extracting audio descriptors from musical signals" 
Author: 	Geoffroy Peeters, Bruno L Giordano, Patrick Susini, Nicolas Misdariis, and Stephen McAdams 
To appear in the Journal of Acoustical Society of America 

The Timbre Toolbox is a set of Matlab functions and mex files for
computing the audio descriptors described in Peeters et al. (in press,
JASA). 

 * History	

The Timbre Toolbox started from the Matlab version of ircamdescriptor (Geoffroy Peeters) 
which itself contains inputs from J. Krimphoff, Nicolas Misdariis, Patrick Susini and Stephen McAdams.
It was then modified at McGill by Cory Kereliuk which made it object-oriented.
It was then modified again by Geoffroy Peeters at Ircam to make the
present version.
